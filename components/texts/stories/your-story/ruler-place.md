title: "The Ruler's Place"
---

After exploring the allegorical woman's body - from head (Spain) through necklace (ships) to feet (Philippines) - where is the ruler?

This step zooms to **x=0.516, y=0.974, zoom=10** - the very bottom of the image. Charles III, the king, is squeezed into a tiny medallion, barely visible.

Natalie Cobo's argument becomes clear through this coordinate choice: the image depicts connection (shipping routes, trade networks) as more important than territory or sovereignty. The king is marginal to this vision of empire.

**Before the Leviathan comparison:**

This detail sets up the contrast with Hobbes's frontispiece in the next step. Notice how the coordinate (extreme zoom to the bottom) emphasizes what's NOT prominent in this image - the ruler himself.
