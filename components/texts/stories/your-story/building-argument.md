title: "Building an Argument"
---

Cobo's narrative arc reveals how this image prioritizes **connection over territory**. Notice how she's moved through the image:

1. Head (Spain) at extreme zoom
2. Necklace (trade/invasion) at extreme zoom
3. Americas (obstacle) at moderate zoom

The coordinate sequence creates the argument. The Americas appear "ill-defined" - nebulous, unclear. This prepares readers for the contrast with the Philippines in the next step.

**In scholarly storytelling:**
- Each step builds on previous steps
- Coordinates serve your thesis
- Zoom levels create emphasis and comparison
