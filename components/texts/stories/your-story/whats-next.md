title: "What's Next?"
---

This template shows how Telar works. The narrative you just experienced demonstrates:

- **Question/Answer/Invitation pattern**: Compelling questions, brief answers, optional deeper context
- **Coordinate-driven storytelling**: Zoom and pan serve your argument
- **Progressive disclosure**: Layer 1 and Layer 2 panels provide depth without interrupting flow
- **Multiple image types**: IIIF and self-hosted images work together
- **Glossary integration**: Define terms once, link everywhere

**To create your own story:**

1. Replace these images and coordinates with your own
2. Write compelling questions that guide readers
3. Keep answers brief (1-2 sentences)
4. Use layer panels for extended context
5. Let your coordinates build your argument

**Acknowledgment:**

This template uses the narrative structure developed by **Natalie Cobo**. Her approach demonstrates how visual exploration can challenge historical narratives and reveal hidden contexts of production.
