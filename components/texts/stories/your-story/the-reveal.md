title: "The Reveal"

Cobo returns to full view (**x=0.5, y=0.5, zoom=1**) for synthesis. After guiding readers through detailed views, pulling back reveals the whole: empire is about connection (shipping routes), not geography (landmasses).

This is a [[step]] in a [[story]] - part of Telar's Question/Answer/Invitation pattern. You're reading a layer 1 panel right now. Click "Progressive Disclosure" below to learn more about how panels work.

**Narrative technique:**
- Zoom in to build argument through details
- Zoom out to synthesize and reveal thesis
- Use full view for orientation and conclusion
