title: "Progressive Disclosure"
---

You're now viewing a **layer 2 panel** - the deepest level of detail in Telar.

**How it works:**
- **Question/Answer**: Main text (left side) - visible immediately
- **Layer 1 panel**: Opens when you click "Learn more" or similar button - provides extended context
- **Layer 2 panel**: This panel - opens from within layer 1 - provides deeper detail

**In your Google Sheet:**
- `layer1_button` = button text ("The Reveal")
- `layer1_file` = path to markdown file (`your-story/the-reveal.md`)
- `layer2_button` = second button text ("Progressive Disclosure")
- `layer2_file` = path to second markdown file (`your-story/progressive-disclosure.md`)

**Glossary linking:**

[[panel|Panels]] like this one can include glossary terms using double-bracket syntax. The [[viewer]] allows readers to explore image details themselves while your text guides their interpretation.

Try it: click on any glossary term (shown in color) to see its definition.
