title: "Visual Rhetoric"

The contrast between nebulous Americas and concrete Philippines is key to Cobo's argument. The zoom coordinates (**x=0.478, y=0.883, zoom=10**) make this comparison visceral - extreme magnification on the feet mirrors the earlier head zoom, creating visual symmetry.

The Philippines aren't shown as vague territory but as specific islands with distinct forms. This challenges the typical narratives where the Americas dominate and Spanish Southeast Asia is peripheral.

**Visual storytelling technique:**
- Use zoom to create parallels (head vs feet, both at zoom=10)
- Position details to build contrasts (nebulous vs concrete)
- Let image details carry argumentative weight
