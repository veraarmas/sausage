title: "Guiding Attention"
---

Imperative questions ("Notice..." "Consider...") direct readers' eyes to specific details. This is part of Telar's **Question/Answer/Invitation pattern**:

- **Question**: Draws viewers in with a compelling heading
- **Answer**: A brief 1-2 sentence response
- **Invitation**: "Learn more" opens panels like this one

Cobo uses this pattern to build a visual argument. Here at **zoom=10**, the extreme magnification emphasizes the necklace's importance - it's made of ships, revealing that empire is built on invasion and trade, not just territory.

**Try this yourself:**
- Write questions that intrigue readers
- Keep answers brief (1-2 sentences)
- Use coordinates to reveal supporting details
