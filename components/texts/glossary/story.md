A sequence of steps that form a visual narrative. Each story appears as a separate entry in the project sheet and can be navigated independently.

In Telar, stories combine text and images to build arguments, explore themes, or guide readers through visual material. The "your-story" template you're viewing is an example of a story that teaches while it tells.
