The interactive image panel on the right side of the screen. It supports high-resolution zoom and pan, allowing readers to explore image details.

The viewer works with both IIIF images (hosted by museums and libraries) and self-hosted images (from your own collection). Readers can zoom and pan freely, but your coordinates guide their initial view at each step.
