A single screen in a Telar story, combining narrative text on the left with an image view on the right. Each step can focus on a different part of an image using coordinates (x, y, zoom).

Steps follow the Question/Answer/Invitation pattern: a compelling question, a brief answer, and optional layer panels for deeper exploration.
